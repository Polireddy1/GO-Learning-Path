Function:
 A function is an independent block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks and can be called by its name.

 Method:
 A method is a function that is associated with a specific type (such as a struct) and has a receiver parameter.


Uses:

 Encapsulation and Data Hiding
 Improved Readability and Maintainability
 Polymorphism 
 Receiver Types (Value vs. Pointer)
   -Value receivers operate on a copy of the struct, making them suitable for read-only operations or
    when you don't want to modify the original data
   -Pointer receivers operate on the original struct, allowing you to modify its state within the method
